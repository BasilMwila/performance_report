## ðŸ”§ Key Field Mapping Corrections

### **1. Principal vs Gross Distinction**
```javascript
// WRONG - Using same field for both
principal_lent: parseFloat(row.gross_lent) || 0, // This was wrong!

// CORRECT - Use separate fields
gross_lent: parseFloat(row.gross_lent) || 0,      // 288,920.22 (includes fees)
principal_lent: parseFloat(row.principal_lent) || 0, // 241,901.00 (loan only)
```

**Why this matters:**
- **Gross Lent**: Total disbursed amount including all fees (288k)
- **Principal Lent**: Actual loan amount given to customers (241k) 
- **Difference**: Service fees and other charges (47k)

### **2. Recovery Amount Breakdown**
```javascript
// Correct recovery calculation
gross_recovered: (parseFloat(row.principal_recovered) || 0) +    // 181,897.21
                (parseFloat(row.sfee_recovered) || 0) +          // 35,278.40  
                (parseFloat(row.late_fees_recovered) || 0) +     // 3,083.37
                // Total should equal 220,258.98
```

### **3. Transaction Count Validation**
```javascript
// Should match exactly
lending_transactions: 1,271 // Total lending transactions
recovery_transactions: 1,114 // Total recovery transactions
```

## ðŸ“Š Expected Dashboard Results
