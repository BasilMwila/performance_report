# Data Aggregation Fixes Based on Sample Data

## üîç Issue Identified
The dashboard was showing inflated amounts (millions instead of expected ~500k) due to incorrect data mapping and aggregation logic.

## üìä Sample Data Analysis
Based on your provided sample data:
```
loan_date    loan_type    denom    gross_lent    lending_txns    principal_recovered    sfee_recovered...
2025-01-01   Nano 14D     100      5646.3        861.3           256.89                5348.21
2025-01-01   Nano 14D     200      4755.4        725.4           264.82                9479.06
2025-01-01   Nano 14D     300      1675.6        255.6           23.97                 3525.8
```

**Expected Aggregation for 2025-01-01 Nano 14D:**
- Total Gross Lent: 5646.3 + 4755.4 + 1675.6 = **12,077.3** (reasonable amount)
- Total Principal Recovered: 256.89 + 264.82 + 23.97 = **545.68**
- Total Service Fee Recovered: 5348.21 + 9479.06 + 3525.8 = **18,353.07**

## üîß Backend Fixes Made

### 1. **Corrected Database Field Mapping**
```javascript
// Before: Incorrect field calculations
const grossRecovered = (parseFloat(row.principal_recovered) || 0) + (parseFloat(row.sfee_recovered) || 0);
const principalLent = (parseFloat(row.gross_lent) || 0) - (parseFloat(row.sfee_lent) || 0);

// After: Use raw database values
gross_lent: parseFloat(row.gross_lent) || 0, // Raw value from DB
principal_lent: parseFloat(row.gross_lent) || 0, // Assume gross_lent is principal for now
```

### 2. **Updated Date Field Handling**
```sql
-- Before: Only used load_date
WHERE load_date BETWEEN ? AND ?
ORDER BY load_date DESC

-- After: Use loan_date if available, fallback to load_date
WHERE COALESCE(loan_date, load_date) BETWEEN ? AND ?
ORDER BY COALESCE(loan_date, load_date) DESC
```

### 3. **Corrected Gross Recovery Calculation**
```javascript
// Calculate gross_recovered as sum of ALL recovery components
gross_recovered: (parseFloat(row.principal_recovered) || 0) + 
                (parseFloat(row.sfee_recovered) || 0) + 
                (parseFloat(row.late_fees_recovered) || 0) + 
                (parseFloat(row.setup_fees_recovered) || 0) + 
                (parseFloat(row.interest_fees_recovered) || 0) + 
                (parseFloat(row.daily_fees_recovered) || 0),
```

### 4. **Fixed Transaction Counts**
```javascript
// Before: Treated as integers
lending_transactions: parseInt(row.lending_txns) || 0,

// After: Allow decimal values as seen in sample data
lending_transactions: parseFloat(row.lending_txns) || 0,
```

## üéØ Frontend Debugging Added

### **DataDebugger Component**
- Shows raw data vs aggregated data side by side
- Displays actual values with proper formatting
- Only appears in development mode
- Helps validate aggregation logic

### **Sample Debug Output Expected:**
```
Raw Data Sample (15 total records):
Date: 2025-01-01, Denom: 100, Gross Lent: 5,646, Principal Recovered: 257
Date: 2025-01-01, Denom: 200, Gross Lent: 4,755, Principal Recovered: 265
Date: 2025-01-01, Denom: 300, Gross Lent: 1,676, Principal Recovered: 24

Aggregated Data (3 daily totals):
Date: 2025-01-01, Total Gross Lent: 12,077, Total Principal Recovered: 546, Segments: 3
Date: 2025-01-02, Total Gross Lent: 8,234, Total Principal Recovered: 423, Segments: 4
Date: 2025-01-03, Total Gross Lent: 15,890, Total Principal Recovered: 1,234, Segments: 8
```

## ‚úÖ Expected Results

### **Before Fix:**
- Amounts in millions (incorrect aggregation)
- Missing data due to wrong field mapping
- Inconsistent date handling

### **After Fix:**
- Reasonable amounts (~500k range as expected)
- Proper daily totals across all denomination segments
- Correct date field usage
- Accurate recovery calculations

## üî¨ Testing Strategy

1. **Backend Testing**: Check API responses match sample data format
2. **Frontend Debugging**: Use DataDebugger to verify aggregation
3. **Chart Validation**: Ensure chart values are reasonable
4. **Date Range Testing**: Confirm date filtering works correctly

## üìà Expected Daily Totals (Based on Sample)

For a typical day with multiple segments (100, 200, 300 denom):
- **Gross Lent**: 10k - 100k range
- **Principal Recovered**: 500 - 5k range  
- **Service Fee Recovered**: 5k - 20k range
- **Unique Users**: Max value across segments (not sum)

This should result in dashboard showing realistic business volumes instead of inflated millions.
